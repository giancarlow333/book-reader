# RavishingReads

## Description

*Ravishing Reads* is a way to journal your book-reading online.  It is a database dedicated to readers to research, store, review/rate, notate, and create a list of future reads.  "RR" utilizes Google Book Search API to return specified information to its database, allows users to sign-up with name, email, and password.  Readers can then search books via Google Books API to add to one of their Reading Lists, add ratings/reviews, and add notes.

## Concept

As a reader, I want to record my literary journey. As a user, we should be able to create an account. Once an account is created you we are directed to a results page. We should be able to search a book via API. I want to be able to add the books that I have already read to a list. I want to add books that I want to read in the future to a list.
